# What the hell is this?

The source for [XDayCountdown.com](https://XDayCountdown.com/).

If you're reading this, I'm probably dead.

Wait.

No.

Wrong project.

This started life as an Svelte/HTML port of my [Dobbsface WearOS watchface](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bytestemplar.subgeniuswatchface).

But it's since grown into a "full website" dedicated to showing the countdown.

Use it for whatever. There isn't really much TO the site.

While I stole and modified the graphics, they aren't my designs. Those belong to [the church](https://subgenius.com/).

And god knows who designed the Diploma font being used here. (Where did I even get it from?)

If you're feeling spendy, throw some coins over on [SubGenius.com](https://SubGenius.com/) and get yourself a [Salvation/Membership/Ordainment kit](http://www.subgenius.com/scatalog/membership.htm)!

Or get one for a friend.

Or just keep buying them until your card is rejected!
